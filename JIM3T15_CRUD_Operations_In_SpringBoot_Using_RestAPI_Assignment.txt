Jhon wants to create and manage a list of tasks they need to complete. please help him to create to-do app using Spring with REST API.

Tasks:

1. Set up the project and configure Spring.
2. Create a ToDo domain model that has the following fields and types:
     id (String), description (String), completed (Boolean), created(date with time), modified (date with time).
3. Create a RESTful API that provides the basic CRUD (create, read,
update, delete) actions. Use the most common HTTP methods: POST, PUT, PATCH, GET, and DELETE

4. Add an error handler when there is a bad request or when submitting
a new ToDo doesnâ€™t have the required fields. The only mandatory
field is the description.

5. All the requests and responses should be in JSON format.

Note: create a Maven project in Eclipse or STS Ide and push it to github.

All the best!
